# **Interview Question Solutions**

Welcome to my intreview solutions repository! ðŸš€ 


## *About This Repository*

As I work through various reasources for interview prep, this repository contains my solutions so far. At the moment, my focus is on the NeetCode 150 problems and the LeetCode SQL 50 Study plan. These are both curated sets of essential coding problems designed to improve problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews. The goal is to solidify my understanding of data structures and algorithms as well as SQL while maintaining clean, well-documented code.

## _Progress_

I am currently working through the NeetCode 150 problems in Java and the LeetCode SQL 50 with MySQL. I will continue updating this repository as I progress.

_NeetCode 150_

âœ… Completed: Arrays & Hashing, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Stack

ðŸš§ In progress: Binary Search, Linked List

ðŸ”œ Upcoming: Trees, Heap/Priority Queue, Backtracking, Tries, Graphs, Advanced Graphs, 1-D DP, 2-D DP, Greedy, Intervals, Math & Geometry, Bit Manipulation

_LeetCode SQL 50_

ðŸš§ In progress: Basic Aggregate Functions

ðŸ”œ Upcoming: Sorting and Grouping, Advanced Select and Joins, Subqueries, Advanced String Functions/Regex/Clause

## _How to Use_

If you're also going through any of these, feel free to reference these solutions and compare approaches. Each solution file includes a link to the problem it's solving, however I highly recommend attempting the problems yourself before reviewing solutions!

## _Contributions_

This repository is primarily for personal learning and progress tracking, but if you find any improvements or have alternative solutions, feel free to open an issue or a pull request. Let's learn together! ðŸ˜Š
