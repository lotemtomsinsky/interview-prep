# **NeetCode Solutions**

Welcome to my intreview solutions repository! ðŸš€ 


## *About This Repository*

As I work through various reasources for interview prep, this repository contains my solutions so far. At the moment, my focus is on the NeetCode 150 problems. This is a curated set of essential coding problems designed to improve problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews. The goal is to solidify my understanding of data structures and algorithms while maintaining clean, well-documented code.

## _Progress_

I am currently working through the NeetCode 150 problems in Java and I will continue updating this repository as I progress.

âœ… Completed: Arrays & Hashing, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Stack

ðŸš§ In progress: Binary Search, Linked List

ðŸ”œ Upcoming: Trees, Heap/Priority Queue, Backtracking, Tries, Graphs, Advanced Graphs, 1-D DP, 2-D DP, Greedy, Intervals, Math & Geometry, Bit Manipulation


## _How to Use_

If you're also going through any of these, feel free to reference these solutions and compare approaches. Each solution file includes a link to the problem it's solving, however I highly recommend attempting the problems yourself before reviewing solutions!

## _Contributions_

This repository is primarily for personal learning and progress tracking, but if you find any improvements or have alternative solutions, feel free to open an issue or a pull request. Let's learn together! ðŸ˜Š
